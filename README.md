# CSE-564-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Lab-2B

## Overview
A D3.js Dashboard utilizing Data Engineering and Visualizing using Multidimensional Scaling Plots and parallel Coordinate Plots. Implemented PCP axes click and order functioning from MDS points and Pearson's Correlations.

## Tasks

### Task 4: MDS Plots
- **Data MDS Plot (4a)**: Construct and visualize a scatterplot of the data using Euclidean distance with metric MDS. Color the points by cluster-ID.
- **Variables' MDS Plot (4b)**: Construct and visualize a scatterplot of the variables using the (1-|correlation|) distance with metric MDS.

### Task 5: Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP)
- Visualize all data dimensions (categorical and numerical) in a parallel coordinates plot.
- Implement meaningful axis ordering through user interaction.
- Color the polylines by cluster ID.

### Task 6: Optimal PCP Axis Ordering
- Determine a good axis ordering for numerical values based on correlations observed in the variablesâ€™ MDS plot. 
- Enable user interaction to click on points in sequence and arrange the axes accordingly.

## Additional Requirements
- Labeling axes and tick marks appropriately.
- Showing colour legends where necessary.
- Providing meaningful headers on each plot.
